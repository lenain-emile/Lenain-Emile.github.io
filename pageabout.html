                <p>I was born on the 8th of March 2005 in Marseille (France). My educational background is rather classical, I obtained my baccalaureate in Mathematics and Economic and Social Sciences. During my last year of primary school, I became interested in the booming IT sector, where I found some joy in programming. I particularly like the creativity that web development requires. My temperament is rather objective, as I prioritise the ideas that will really advance my project, rather than my tastes and preferences. I'm also very open-minded, which means I can work with all kinds of profiles.
